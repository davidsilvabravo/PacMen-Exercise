# PacMen-Exercise
## Description
Generate as many pacman as wanted and make them move on browser's window, just by clicking on "Add PacMan" and "Start Game" buttons.

## How to run
You just need to download all these files from the repo, and put them together on a single folder:
- images/pacman1
- images/pacman2
- images/pacman3
- images/pacman4
- index.html
- pacmen.js
Then, just open index.html on your browser.

Once the page loads, you'll have just 2 options:
- click on "Add PacMan" to create a new PacMan on screen
- click on "Start Game" to make all PacMan created to start running

## Roadmap of future improvements
They were added new functionalities to make PacMen to open and close their mouth while moving, and also, to change direction when reaching left and right borders of screen.
No new additional improvements planned yet.
